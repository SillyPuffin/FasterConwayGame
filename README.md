# A more Optimised Approach

## What is the point
***

I just felt that my first attempt at Conway's GOL was not as fast as it could be and the code is not that great given
it is my first time using c++ meaningfully, so my plan with this is to do a bit more research into a better algorithm as well
as use a slightly better knowledge of c++ to hopefully make the code a bit better.
